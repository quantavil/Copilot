We will calculate the overall profit based on the given individual cost prices and profit conditions, while acknowledging this inconsistency.\n\n1.  **Profit on Table:**\n    *   Cost Price of Table (CP_T) = Rs. 180\n    *   Profit on Table (P_T) = 30% of CP_T = 0.30 * 180 = Rs. 54\n\n2.  **Profit on Chair:**\n    *   Profit on Chair (P_C) = P_T + 30 = 54 + 30 = Rs. 84\n\n3.  **Overall Profit:**\n    *   Overall Profit = P_T + P_C = 54 + 84 = Rs. 138\n\nTherefore, the overall profit received by the shopkeeper (based on individual cost prices of Rs. 180 and Rs. 140) is Rs. 138.\n\n**Solution to Interest Problem 1:**\n\n1.  **Compound Interest Calculation:**\n    *   Principal (P1) = Rs. 12,000\n    *   Time (T1) = 2 years\n    *   Rate = r% (compound interest)\n    *   Amount after 2 years (A1) = 12000 * (1 + r/100)^2\n\n2.  **Simple Interest Calculation:**\n    *   Principal (P2) = A1\n    *   Rate (r_SI) = 6.25%\n    *   Time (T2) = 4 years\n    *   Final Amount (A_final) = Rs. 25,350\n    *   A_final = P2 * (1 + r_SI * T2 / 100)\n    *   25350 = A1 * (1 + 6.25 * 4 / 100)\n    *   25350 = A1 * (1 + 25 / 100)\n    *   25350 = A1 * 1.25\n    *   A1 = 25350 / 1.25 = 20280\n\n3.  **Solving for r:**\n    *   Substitute A1 back into the compound interest formula:\n    *   20280 = 12000 * (1 + r/100)^2\n    *   (1 + r/100)^2 = 20280 / 12000\n    *   (1 + r/100)^2 = 1.69\n    *   1 + r/100 = √1.69\n    *   1 + r/100 = 1.3\n    *   r/100 = 0.3\n    *   r = 30\n\nTherefore, the value of r is 30.\n\n**Solution to Mixtures and Alligations Problem 1:**\n\n1.  **Initial Mixture:**\n    *   Total Volume = y liters\n    *   Milk = 0.75y\n    *   Water = 0.25y\n\n2.  **After y/2 liters taken out:**\n    *   Milk taken out = 0.75 * (y/2) = 0.375y\n    *   Water taken out = 0.25 * (y/2) = 0.125y\n    *   Remaining Milk = 0.75y - 0.375y = 0.375y\n    *   Remaining Water = 0.25y - 0.125y = 0.125y\n\n3.  **After y/2 liters of milk added:**\n    *   New Milk = 0.375y + y/2 = 0.375y + 0.5y = 0.875y\n    *   New Water = 0.125y\n\n4.  **Milk is x% more than Water:**\n    *   New Milk = New Water * (1 + x/100)\n    *   0.875y = 0.125y * (1 + x/100)\n    *   Divide by 0.125y:\n    *   7 = 1 + x/100\n    *   6 = x/100\n    *   x = 600\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 600.\n\n**Solution to Mixtures and Alligations Problem 2:**\n\n1.  **Total Cost Price:**\n    *   Quantity of Juice A = x liters; Cost = 52x\n    *   Quantity of Juice B = (x - 20) liters; Cost = 44(x - 20)\n    *   Total Cost Price (CP_total) = 52x + 44(x - 20) = 52x + 44x - 880 = 96x - 880\n\n2.  **Total Selling Price:**\n    *   Profit = 25%\n    *   Total Selling Price (SP_total) = 2500\n    *   SP_total = CP_total * (1 + 25/100) = CP_total * 1.25\n    *   2500 = (96x - 880) * 1.25\n\n3.  **Solving for x:**\n    *   2500 / 1.25 = 96x - 880\n    *   2000 = 96x - 880\n    *   2880 = 96x\n    *   x = 30\n\n4.  **Cost Price per liter after mixing:**\n    *   CP_total = 96 * 30 - 880 = 2880 - 880 = Rs. 2,000\n    *   Total quantity of mixture = x + (x - 20) = 30 + (30 - 20) = 30 + 10 = 40 liters\n    *   Cost price per liter = CP_total / Total quantity = 2000 / 40 = Rs. 50\n\nTherefore, the cost price per liter after mixing juices A and B is Rs. 50.\n\n**Solution to Partnership Problem 1:**\n\n1.  **A's Equivalent Investment for 1 year:**\n    *   Initial investment = Rs. 8,000 for x months\n    *   Doubled investment = Rs. 16,000 for (12 - x) months\n    *   A's Equivalent Investment = (8000 * x) + (16000 * (12 - x))\n    *   = 8000x + 192000 - 16000x = 192000 - 8000x\n\n2.  **B's Equivalent Investment for 1 year:**\n    *   Investment = Rs. 12,000 for 12 months\n    *   B's Equivalent Investment = 12000 * 12 = 144000\n\n3.  **Ratio of Profits (A:B):**\n    *   Ratio = (192000 - 8000x) : 144000\n    *   Divide by 8000: (24 - x) : 18\n\n4.  **Profit Shares:**\n    *   Profit share of B = Rs. 54,000\n    *   Profit share of A = 54000 + 600x\n\n5.  **Solving for x:**\n    *   (Profit share of A) / (Profit share of B) = (24 - x) / 18\n    *   (54000 + 600x) / 54000 = (24 - x) / 18\n    *   Divide left side by 600: (90 + x) / 90 = (24 - x) / 18\n    *   90 + x = (24 - x) * (90 / 18)\n    *   90 + x = (24 - x) * 5\n    *   90 + x = 120 - 5x\n    *   6x = 30\n    *   x = 5\n\nTherefore, A increased his investment after 5 months.\n\n**Solution to Work and Time Problem 1:**\n\n1.  **C's Efficiency:**\n    *   C completed 1/4 of work in 16 days.\n    *   Time for C to complete whole work = 16 * 4 = 64 days.\n    *   C's 1-day work = 1/64.\n\n2.  **B's Efficiency:**\n    *   B is 20% more efficient than C.\n    *   B's 1-day work = 1.20 * (1/64) = 1.2 / 64 = 12 / 640 = 3 / 160.\n\n3.  **A's Efficiency:**\n    *   Time for A to complete whole work = 32 days.\n    *   A's 1-day work = 1/32.\n\n4.  **Work done by A and B together:**\n    *   A and B worked for x days.\n    *   Combined 1-day work of A and B = 1/32 + 3/160 = 5/160 + 3/160 = 8/160 = 1/20.\n    *   Work done by A and B in x days = x * (1/20) = x/20.\n\n5.  **Solving for x:**\n    *   Remaining work = 1 - (x/20).\n    *   Given, remaining work = 1/4.\n    *   1 - x/20 = 1/4\n    *   1 - 1/4 = x/20\n    *   3/4 = x/20\n    *   x = (3/4) * 20\n    *   x = 15\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 15.\n\n**Solution to Pipes and Cisterns Problem 1:**\n\n1.  **Rates of A and B:**\n    *   Efficiency ratio A:B = 2:1.\n    *   B fills the tank in 24 minutes, so B's rate = 1/24 tank/minute.\n    *   A's rate = 2 * (1/24) = 1/12 tank/minute.\n\n2.  **Time for A and B together:**\n    *   Combined rate of A and B = 1/12 + 1/24 = 3/24 = 1/8 tank/minute.\n    *   Time for A and B together to fill whole tank = 8 minutes.\n    *   Time for A and B together to fill 3/4 of the tank (T_AB_3/4) = (3/4) * 8 = 6 minutes.\n\n3.  **Rate of C:**\n    *   Ratio of (T_AB_3/4) to (Time for C to empty half tank, T_C_half) = 2:3.\n    *   6 / T_C_half = 2/3\n    *   T_C_half = 6 * (3/2) = 9 minutes.\n    *   Time for C to empty whole tank = 9 * 2 = 18 minutes.\n    *   C's emptying rate = -1/18 tank/minute.\n\n4.  **Time for all pipes together:**\n    *   Combined rate of A, B, and C = 1/12 + 1/24 - 1/18\n    *   LCM of 12, 24, 18 is 72.\n    *   = 6/72 + 3/72 - 4/72 = (6 + 3 - 4) / 72 = 5/72 tank/minute.\n    *   Time to fill the tank = 1 / (5/72) = 72/5 = 14.4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the time taken by all pipes together to fill the tank is 14.4 minutes.\n\n**Solution to Time, Speed and Distance Problem 1:**\n\n1.  **Downstream and Upstream Speeds in terms of x:**\n    *   Downstream speed (V_d) = x km / 6 hours = x/6 km/hr\n    *   Upstream speed (V_u) = x km / 10 hours = x/10 km/hr\n\n2.  **Speed of Boat (V_b) and Stream (V_s):**\n    *   V_d = V_b + V_s  => V_b + V_s = x/6\n    *   V_u = V_b - V_s  => V_b - V_s = x/10\n    *   Adding the two equations: 2 * V_b = x/6 + x/10 = (5x + 3x)/30 = 8x/30 = 4x/15\n    *   V_b = 2x/15 km/hr\n    *   Subtracting the second from the first: 2 * V_s = x/6 - x/10 = (5x - 3x)/30 = 2x/30 = x/15\n    *   V_s = x/30 km/hr\n\n3.  **Using Still Water Information:**\n    *   Distance = (x + 20) km\n    *   Time = 8 hours 30 minutes = 8.5 hours\n    *   Speed = V_b = 2x/15\n    *   Distance = Speed * Time\n    *   x + 20 = (2x/15) * 8.5\n    *   x + 20 = 17x / 15\n    *   15(x + 20) = 17x\n    *   15x + 300 = 17x\n    *   300 = 2x\n    *   x = 150\n\n4.  **Finding Upstream Speed:**\n    *   Upstream speed (V_u) = x/10\n    *   V_u = 150 / 10 = 15 km/hr\n\nTherefore, the upstream speed of the boat is 15 km/hr.",

However, since you asked to \"show solution\" without specifying which one, I assume you are referring to the first mensuration problem that we discussed.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n**Mensuration Problem 1 Solution:**\n\n1.  **Find the side of the square:**\n    *   Area of square = side²\n    *   576 cm² = side²\n    *   side = √576 = 24 cm\n\n2.  **Find the perimeter of the square:**\n    *   Perimeter of square = 4 * side\n    *   Perimeter of square = 4 * 24 cm = 96 cm\n\n3.  **Relate the perimeter of the square to P:**\n    *   The problem states the perimeter of the square is (P - 24) cm.\n    *   So, 96 cm = P - 24 cm\n    *   P = 96 + 24 = 120 cm\n\n4.  **Find the perimeter of the rectangle:**\n    *   The problem states the perimeter of the rectangle is P cm.\n    *   Perimeter of rectangle = 120 cm\n\n5.  **Set up the perimeter of the rectangle using length and breadth:**\n    *   Perimeter of rectangle = 2 * (length + breadth)\n    *   120 cm = 2 * (2.7z + 3.3z)\n    *   120 cm = 2 * (6z)\n    *   120 cm = 12z\n\n6.  **Solve for z:**\n    *   z = 120 cm / 12 = 10 cm\n\n7.  **Find the length and breadth of the rectangle:**\n    *   Length = 2.7z = 2.7 * 10 cm = 27 cm\n    *   Breadth = 3.3z = 3.3 * 10 cm = 33 cm\n\n8.  **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**\n    *   Area of rectangle = length * breadth\n    *   Area of rectangle = 27 cm * 33 cm = 891 cm²\n\nTherefore, the area of the rectangle is 891 cm².",
