It's designed to be a quick review, so ensure you've covered these topics in detail with your study materials.\n\n**I. Algebra**\n\n*   **Basic Operations:**\n    *   Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)\n    *   Properties of numbers (commutative, associative, distributive)\n    *   Fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios, and proportions\n*   **Expressions and Equations:**\n    *   Simplifying algebraic expressions (combining like terms, distributing)\n    *   Solving linear equations in one variable\n    *   Solving systems of linear equations (substitution, elimination, graphing)\n    *   Solving quadratic equations (factoring, completing the square, quadratic formula)\n    *   Inequalities (linear and quadratic)\n*   **Exponents and Radicals:**\n    *   Laws of exponents ($a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$, $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$, etc.)\n    *   Simplifying expressions with exponents\n    *   Rational exponents ($a^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]{a}$)\n    *   Simplifying radical expressions\n*   **Polynomials:**\n    *   Adding, subtracting, and multiplying polynomials\n    *   Factoring polynomials (GCF, difference of squares, trinomials, etc.)\n*   **Functions:**\n    *   Understanding function notation ($f(x)$)\n    *   Evaluating functions\n    *   Domain and range of functions\n    *   Graphing basic functions (linear, quadratic, absolute value)\n\n**II. Geometry**\n\n*   **Basic Concepts:**\n    *   Points, lines, planes, angles\n    *   Types of angles (acute, obtuse, right, straight, complementary, supplementary)\n    *   Parallel and perpendicular lines\n*   **Polygons:**\n    *   Triangles (types, angle sum, Pythagorean theorem, special triangles like 30-60-90 and 45-45-90)\n    *   Quadrilaterals (properties of squares, rectangles, parallelograms, trapezoids)\n    *   Perimeter and area of polygons\n*   **Circles:**\n    *   Radius, diameter, circumference, area\n    *   Arcs, sectors, segments\n    *   Angles and lines in circles (central angles, inscribed angles, tangents)\n*   **Solid Geometry (often limited in prelims):**\n    *   Perimeter, surface area, and volume of basic shapes (cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders, spheres, cones)\n\n**III. Trigonometry (often introductory)**\n\n*   **Right Triangle Trigonometry:**\n    *   SOH CAH TOA (sine, cosine, tangent)\n    *   Finding missing sides and angles in right triangles\n*   **Unit Circle (sometimes):**\n    *   Understanding trigonometric functions for angles beyond 90 degrees\n    *   Basic trigonometric identities (e.g., $\\sin^2 \\theta + \\cos^2 \\theta = 1$)\n\n**IV. Measurement and Units**\n\n*   **Units of Length, Area, Volume, Mass, Time**\n*   **Conversions between units** (within and between metric and imperial systems)\n\n**V. Data Analysis and Probability (often basic)**\n\n*   **Data Representation:**\n    *   Bar graphs, histograms, line graphs, pie charts\n    *   Reading and interpreting data from graphs\n*   **Measures of Central Tendency:**\n    *   Mean, median, mode\n*   **Measures of Spread (sometimes):**\n    *   Range\n*   **Probability:**\n    *   Basic probability calculations (likelihood of events)\n    *   Independent and dependent events (sometimes)\n\n**VI. Problem Solving Strategies**\n\n*   **Understand the Question:** Read carefully and identify what is being asked.\n*   **Identify Key Information:** Underline or list the important numbers and conditions.\n*   **Choose the Right Approach:** Select the appropriate mathematical concepts and formulas.\n*   **Show Your Work:** Write down each step clearly.\n*   **Check Your Answer:** Does your answer make sense in the context of the problem?\n\n**Key Tips for Prelims:**\n\n*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Work through as many problems as possible from your textbook, past papers, and online resources.\n*   **Understand Concepts, Don't Just Memorize:** Focus on why formulas work, not just what they are.\n*   **Time Management:** Practice solving problems under timed conditions.\n*   **Review Formulas:** Make sure you have a solid grasp of all the relevant formulas.\n*   **Stay Calm:** If you encounter a difficult problem, take a deep breath and break it down.\n\nThis summary is a general guide. **Always refer to your specific course syllabus and your instructor's guidance for the exact topics and emphasis for your preliminary exams.** Good luck!",
