The key here is that it uses the `yield` keyword, which makes it a generator function.\n\n2.  **`yield 2`**: The number 2 is the first and only even prime number. We yield it immediately.\n\n3.  **`primes = [2]`**: We initialize a list called `primes` to store the prime numbers we've found so far. This list is crucial for checking the primality of subsequent numbers.\n\n4.  **`num = 3`**: We start checking for primality from the number 3.\n\n5.  **`while True:`**: This creates an infinite loop, meaning the generator will continue to produce prime numbers as long as you request them.\n\n6.  **`is_prime = True`**: For each `num`, we assume it's prime until proven otherwise.\n\n7.  **Optimization: Checking divisibility up to the square root:**\n    *   **`for p in primes:`**: We iterate through the `primes` list (which contains all the prime numbers found so far).\n    *   **`if p * p > num:`**: This is a significant optimization. If `num` has a divisor, it must have at least one divisor less than or equal to its square root. If the square of the current prime `p` is already greater than `num`, it means any subsequent prime in `primes` will also have its square greater than `num`. Therefore, `num` cannot be divisible by any of them, and we can `break` out of the inner loop.\n    *   **`if num % p == 0:`**: If `num` is divisible by any of the primes `p` in our `primes` list, it means `num` is not prime. We set `is_prime` to `False` and `break` the inner loop.\n\n8.  **`if is_prime:`**: If after checking against all relevant primes, `is_prime` is still `True`, it means `num` is indeed a prime number.\n    *   **`primes.append(num)`**: We add this newly found prime to our `primes` list.\n    *   **`yield num`**: The `yield` keyword returns the prime number to the caller. The function's state is saved, and it will resume from where it left off the next time `next()` is called on the generator.\n\n9.  **`num += 2`**: We increment `num` by 2. This is another optimization because after checking 2, we only need to consider odd numbers as potential primes.\n\n**How Generators Work:**\n\n*   **Lazy Evaluation:** Generators produce values one at a time, on demand. This is memory-efficient, especially for sequences that are very long or infinite.\n*   **`yield` Keyword:** Instead of `return`, generators use `yield`. When `yield` is encountered, the function pauses its execution and returns the yielded value. The next time `next()` is called on the generator, the function resumes from exactly where it left off.\n*   **`next()` Function:** You use the `next()` function (or a `for` loop, which implicitly calls `next()`) to retrieve values from a generator.\n*   **`StopIteration`:** When a generator function finishes (i.e., reaches the end of the function or a `return` statement without a value), it raises a `StopIteration` exception, signaling that there are no more values to yield. In our case, `while True` prevents `StopIteration` from being naturally reached.",

          "content": "You're looking for a Python function that generates prime numbers. I'll provide two common approaches:\n\n1.  **A simple, indefinite prime generator (Trial Division):** This generates primes one by one forever.\n2.  **A generator using the Sieve of Eratosthenes (up to a limit):** This is much more efficient for generating all primes within a specific range.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Simple Indefinite Prime Generator (Trial Division)\n\nThis generator yields prime numbers indefinitely. It uses a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime by trial division.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number n is prime.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if n is prime, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 2:\n        return False  # Numbers less than 2 are not prime\n    if n == 2:\n        return True   # 2 is the only even prime\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return False  # Other even numbers are not prime\n\n    # Check for odd divisors from 3 up to sqrt(n)\n    # We only need to check up to the square root because if n has a divisor\n    # larger than its square root, it must also have one smaller than its square root.\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1\n    for i in range(3, limit, 2):  # Step by 2 to check only odd numbers\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True # If no divisors found, it's prime\n\ndef prime_generator():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates an infinite sequence of prime numbers.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The next prime number.\n    \"\"\"\n    yield 2  # The first prime number\n    n = 3\n    while True:\n        if is_prime(n):\n            yield n\n        n += 2  # Skip even numbers, as they cannot be prime (except 2)\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"--- Simple Indefinite Prime Generator ---\")\n    primes = prime_generator()\n\n    print(\"First 10 primes:\")\n    for _ in range(10):\n        print(next(primes))\n\n    print(\"\\nNext 5 primes:\")\n    for _ in range(5):\n        print(next(primes))\n\n    # You can keep calling next(primes) to get more primes\n    # Or iterate a fixed number of times in a loop\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`is_prime(n)`**:\n    *   Handles base cases: numbers less than 2 are not prime; 2 is prime; other even numbers are not prime.\n    *   It then checks for odd divisors from 3 up to the square root of `n`. If any divisor is found, `n` is not prime.\n*   **`prime_generator()`**:\n    *   First `yield`s `2` as it's the only even prime.\n    *   Starts checking from `n = 3`.\n    *   In an infinite `while True` loop, it calls `is_prime()` for `n`. If prime, it `yield`s `n`.\n    *   `n += 2` increments `n` by 2, ensuring only odd numbers are checked (which is more efficient).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Prime Generator using Sieve of Eratosthenes (Up to a Limit)\n\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is a highly efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit. This function generates them in order up to that limit.\n\n```python\ndef sieve_prime_generator(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates prime numbers up to a specified limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.\n\n    Args:\n        limit (int): The upper bound (inclusive) for prime generation.\n\n    Yields:\n        int: The next prime number up to the limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    if limit < 2:\n        return # No primes less than 2\n\n    # Create a boolean list \"is_prime[0...limit]\" and initialize\n    # all entries it as true. A value in is_prime[i] will\n    # finally be false if i is Not a prime, else true.\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False # 0 and 1 are not prime\n\n    # Start checking from p = 2\n    for p in range(2, limit + 1):\n        # If is_prime[p] is still true, then it is a prime\n        if is_prime[p]:\n            yield p # Yield the prime number\n\n            # Mark all multiples of p as not prime.\n            # Start from p*p because smaller multiples (p*2, p*3 etc.)\n            # would have already been marked by smaller primes (2, 3 etc.).\n            for multiple in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):\n                is_prime[multiple] = False\n\n# --- Example Usage ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"\\n--- Sieve of Eratosthenes Prime Generator (Up to Limit) ---\")\n\n    print(\"Primes up to 30:\")\n    for prime in sieve_prime_generator(30):\n        print(prime)\n\n    print(\"\\nPrimes up to 100:\")\n    primes_up_to_100 = list(sieve_prime_generator(100))\n    print(primes_up_to_100)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`sieve_prime_generator(limit)`**:\n    *   It creates a boolean list `is_prime` of size `limit + 1`, initially assuming all numbers are prime.\n    *   It marks `0` and `1` as not prime.\n    *   It iterates from `p = 2` up to `limit`:\n        *   If `is_prime[p]` is still `True`, it means `p` has not been marked as a multiple of any smaller prime, so `p` *is* prime. It `yield`s `p`.\n        *   Then, it marks all multiples of `p` (starting from `p*p`) as `False` (not prime). This is the core \"sieving\" step. Numbers like `2*p`, `3*p` etc., would have already been handled by `2` or `3` themselves, so `p*p` is the first multiple that *needs* to be marked by `p`.\n\n**When to use which:**\n\n*   **`prime_generator()` (Trial Division):** Use this if you need to generate primes indefinitely or if you only need a few primes and don't care about the most optimal performance for very large numbers. It's memory-efficient because it doesn't store a large list of numbers.\n*   **`sieve_prime_generator(limit)` (Sieve of Eratosthenes):** Use this when you need to find *all* prime numbers up to a specific, relatively large limit. It's much faster for this purpose because it avoids repeated division checks. However, it requires more memory to store the `is_prime` boolean list.",

If `d` is greater than `sqrt(num)`, then `num/d` must be less than `sqrt(num)`. So, checking up to `sqrt(num)` is sufficient.\n        *   We increment `i` by 2 (`i += 2`) to only check odd numbers, as we've already ruled out even divisors.\n    *   If no divisors are found within this range, the number is prime.\n\n2.  **`prime_generator()` Function:**\n    *   **`yield 2`**: We explicitly yield 2 as the first prime.\n    *   **`number = 3`**: We start checking from 3.\n    *   **`while True:`**: This loop runs indefinitely, as a generator can produce an infinite sequence of primes. The generator pauses execution after each `yield` and resumes from where it left off when `next()` is called again.\n    *   **`if is_prime(number): yield number`**: If the current `number` is prime, it's yielded.\n    *   **`number += 2`**: We increment `number` by 2 to only check odd numbers. This significantly reduces the number of checks needed, as all primes greater than 2 are odd.\n\n### How to Use the Generator:\n\n*   **Create an instance:** `primes = prime_generator()`\n*   **Get the next prime:** `next(primes)`\n*   **Iterate (e.g., get the first N primes):**\n    ```python\n    for _ in range(10):\n        print(next(primes))\n    ```",
