There are three main types of conjunctions:\n\n### **1. Coordinating Conjunctions**\n\nThese conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses that are grammatically equal. The most common coordinating conjunctions can be remembered with the acronym **FANBOYS**:\n\n*   **F**or - _Example: I want to go, **for** I have a day off._\n*   **A**nd - _Example: She likes apples **and** bananas._\n*   **N**or - _Example: He doesn't like tea, **nor** does he like coffee._\n*   **B**ut - _Example: It was cold, **but** we went for a walk._\n*   **O**r - _Example: Would you like tea **or** coffee?_\n*   **Y**et - _Example: He studied hard, **yet** he failed the exam._\n*   **S**o - _Example: She was tired, **so** she went to bed early._\n\n### **2. Subordinating Conjunctions**\n\nThese conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause. The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Some common subordinating conjunctions include:\n\n*   **Time:** _after, as, as if, as long as, because, before, even if, even though, if, in order that, provided that, since, so that, than, that, though, unless, until, when, whenever, where, wherever, while_\n    *   _Example: **After** he finished his work, he went home._\n    *   _Example: I will call you **when** I arrive._\n*   **Cause/Reason:** _as, because, since_\n    *   _Example: **Because** it was raining, we stayed inside._\n*   **Purpose:** _in order that, so that_\n    *   _Example: He saved money **so that** he could buy a car._\n*   **Condition:** _if, unless, provided that_\n    *   _Example: **If** you study, you will pass._\n*   **Contrast:** _although, but, even though, in spite of, nevertheless, provided that, rather than, still, though, whereas, while_\n    *   _Example: **Although** it was difficult, she succeeded._\n\n### **3. Correlative Conjunctions**\n\nThese conjunctions work in pairs to connect words, phrases, or clauses. They always appear in the same grammatical position. Some common correlative conjunctions are:\n\n*   **Both...and** - _Example: **Both** the cat **and** the dog are sleeping._\n*   **Either...or** - _Example: You can have **either** the red one **or** the blue one._\n*   **Neither...nor** - _Example: **Neither** the book **nor** the movie was interesting._\n*   **Not only...but also** - _Example: **Not only** is she intelligent, **but** she is also kind._\n*   **Whether...or** - _Example: I don't know **whether** to go **or** stay._\n\nConjunctions are vital for building complex sentences and showing the relationships between different ideas.

          "content": "## Essay on Cow\n\nThe cow, often referred to as \"Gau Mata\" (mother cow) in India, holds a sacred and revered status in Hindu culture. More than just a farm animal, the cow symbolizes nourishment, gentleness, and purity. Its presence is deeply intertwined with the spiritual, social, and economic fabric of Indian life.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, the cow is a bovine mammal, typically domesticated for its milk, meat, and hide. However, its importance transcends mere utility. Cows are herbivores, known for their docile nature and their ability to convert grass and other vegetation into nutrient-rich milk. This milk is a cornerstone of many diets, providing essential proteins, fats, and calcium. In India, milk from cows is not only a food source but also a key ingredient in traditional sweets, yogurt (dahi), and clarified butter (ghee), which is used in cooking and religious ceremonies.\n\nBeyond milk, cow dung has historically been a valuable resource. Dried cow dung cakes are used as fuel for cooking, particularly in rural areas, reducing reliance on wood and preserving forests. Cow dung is also a rich organic fertilizer, enhancing soil fertility and supporting agricultural productivity without the need for synthetic chemicals. This makes the cow an integral part of the agrarian ecosystem.\n\nSpiritually, the cow is worshipped as a manifestation of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. Various parts of the cow are considered sacred and are associated with different deities. For instance, its urine (gomutra) is believed to have medicinal properties in Ayurvedic tradition, and its dung is used for purification. The act of protecting and serving cows is considered a virtuous deed, earning spiritual merit.\n\nThe cow's gentle and nurturing disposition has also made it a symbol of motherly love and sustenance. Its quiet patience and constant provision of nourishment have earned it the epithet \"Gau Mata.\" This deep affection is reflected in the laws and societal attitudes that protect cows in many parts of India, where their slaughter is often restricted or banned.\n\nHowever, the reverence for cows also presents challenges. Managing stray cattle, ensuring their proper care and preventing them from damaging crops, is a significant issue in many urban and rural areas. Balancing cultural respect with practical management requires thoughtful policies and community involvement.\n\nIn conclusion, the cow is far more than an animal; it is a cultural icon, a spiritual symbol, and an economic asset in India. Its multifaceted role, from providing sustenance and fuel to embodying divine qualities, underscores its profound significance in the Indian way of life. The enduring bond between the people and the cow is a testament to its enduring value.",

Floors are numbered 1 (ground) to 5 (top). Each floor has two flats: Flat-1 (West) and Flat-2 (East).\n\n**Clues:**\n\n1.  R lives on an odd-numbered floor.\n2.  U and C live in the same flat number.\n3.  S and B live on the same floor.\n4.  D does not live in Flat-2.\n5.  There is a gap of two floors between R and Q.\n6.  Q and R do not live in the same flat number.\n7.  U lives immediately above Q, in the same flat number.\n8.  There is a gap of one floor between U and C.\n9.  F lives on an even-numbered floor, below B, and both live in the same flat number.\n10. E lives above T, and both live in the same flat number.\n11. D and T live in different flats and on different floors.\n\n**Building Layout:**\n\n| Floor | Flat-1 (West) | Flat-2 (East) |\n| ----- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| 5     | D             | R             |\n| 4     | S             | B             |\n| 3     | U             | E             |\n| 2     | Q             | F             |\n| 1     | C             | T             |\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n*   Assign values: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21.\n*   Row 5: D (4) * R (18) = 72\n*   Row 4: S (19) * B (2) = 38\n*   Row 3: U (21) * E (5) = 105\n*   Row 2: Q (17) * F (6) = 102\n*   Row 1: C (3) * T (20) = 60\n*   **Total Sum:** 72 + 38 + 105 + 102 + 60 = **377**\n\n---\n\n### **Set 5: Companions, Dress Colors, and Vehicles**\n\nSeven companions – Liam, Maya, Noah, Olivia, Peter, Quinn, and Riley – attended a gathering, each with a unique dress color (Rose, Amber, Obsidian, Forest, Gold, Slate, Burgundy) and arrived in a distinct vehicle color (Slate, Amber, Rose, Obsidian, Azure, Gold, Ivory). No individual's dress color matches their car color.\n\n**Clues:**\n\n*   Maya is dressed in Amber and did not arrive in an Azure or Gold vehicle.\n*   Olivia is wearing a Forest-colored dress and drove an Ivory car.\n*   Liam's dress color is identical to Quinn's car color.\n*   Peter's dress color matches Noah's car color.\n*   Riley is wearing a Slate-colored dress, and Peter arrived in a Slate-colored car.\n*   Quinn is neither wearing a Gold-colored dress nor arrived in a Gold-colored car.\n*   The combination of an Amber dress and a Slate car (or vice-versa) does not belong to any attendee.\n*   Noah is not wearing a Gold-colored dress, and Liam is not wearing a Rose-colored dress.\n\n**Analysis Notes for Puzzle Solving:**\n\n*   If options involve \"ALL,\" \"ANY,\" \"EITHER,\" or \"BOTH,\" they are often the correct answer.\n*   If options are complex and time-consuming, consider checking them from the bottom up.\n\n---\n\nSimple arithmetic: 7 + 9 = 16",
