Each car is also of a different color: Golden, Silver, Black, White, Yellow, Blue, and Red. The order is not necessarily the same.\n\n**Clues:**\n\n*   N drives either a Blue or White car.\n*   Neither Toyota nor Ford is Blue.\n*   Either L or N drives Tesla.\n*   Tesla and Hyundai are Red and Black in color (not necessarily in the same order).\n*   Either P or R drives the Red car.\n*   Neither BMW nor Audi is Silver in color.\n*   Neither Q nor O drives the Silver car.\n*   O drives either the Black or the Golden car.\n*   Neither M nor O drives either Ford or Toyota.\n*   R drives an Audi.\n*   M does not drive BMW.\n*   Ford is not White in color.\n\n**Solution Table:**\n\n| ID  | Car Make | Color  |\n| --- | -------- | ------ |\n| L   | Tesla    | Black  |\n| N   | Toyota   | White  |\n| O   | BMW      | Golden |\n| P   | Hyundai  | Red    |\n| Q   | Ford     | Yellow |\n| R   | Audi     | Blue   |\n| M   | Maruti   | Silver |\n\n---\n\n### **Set 2: Family Picnic Planning**\n\nEight people – A, B, C, D, J, K, L, and M – belong to the same family with three generations. They are planning a picnic on two different dates (3rd or 16th) in four different months: January, April, June, and August of the same year.\n\n**Clues:**\n\n*   B's son plans on an even-numbered date of a month with an even number of days.\n*   J is the son of B and planned immediately after the father of A.\n*   D is the brother-in-law of C, and vice versa.\n*   C's daughter planned adjacent to her uncle.\n*   Only two people planned between B's son and J's only brother.\n*   The only daughter of A planned after her father.\n*   The mother of A plans after her grandchildren.\n*   The father of K is the son-in-law of L, who is the mother of D.\n*   The number of people who planned before J is the same as after the spouse of A.\n*   The number of people planned between D's father and A's daughter is the same as between A and the brother of D.\n*   K is the son of J's mother's only daughter.\n\n**Solution Table:**\n\n| Date     | Person |\n|----------|--------|\n| Jan 3    | A      |\n| Jan 16   | K      |\n| Apr 3    | B      |\n| Apr 16   | J      |\n| Jun 3    | C      |\n| Jun 16   | M      |\n| Aug 3    | D      |\n| Aug 16   | L      |\n\n**Family Structure:**\n\n*   **Grandparents:** B (grandfather) and L (grandmother)\n*   **Children:** J (son), D (son), A (only daughter)\n*   **A's Spouse:** C (son-in-law of L)\n*   **A & C's Children:** K (son), M (only daughter)\n\n---\n\n### **Set 3: Student Birthdays and Games**\n\nTen students – P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, and Y – were born in five different months (June, July, August, September, October) in two different years (1997 or 2000). Each student likes a different game: Bingo, Charades, Bleep, Pictionary, Hot Potato, Puzzle, Hangman, Quizalize, Crazy train, and Crosswords.\n\n**Clues:**\n\n*   Three students were born between W and Q, who likes Charades.\n*   S does not like Bleep.\n*   Three students were born between V and the student who likes Crazy train.\n*   Two students were born between X and U, who likes Hangman.\n*   Six students were born between S and W, who was born in a leap year.\n*   P was born immediately before T, who was not born in a leap year.\n*   The student who likes Quizalize was born immediately after Y, who likes Hot Potato.\n*   R, who likes Puzzle, was born immediately after U.\n*   Three students were born between Q and X, who likes Bingo.\n*   Only one student was born between P and the student who likes Pictionary.\n\n**Solution Table (Sorted by Date):**\n\n| (Year Month) | Student | Game         |\n|--------------|---------|--------------|\n| 1997 June    | V       | Bleep        |\n| 1997 July    | W       | Pictionary   |\n| 1997 August  | Y       | Hot Potato   |\n| 1997 Sept    | P       | Quizalize    |\n| 1997 Oct     | T       | Crazy Train  |\n| 2000 June    | Q       | Charades     |\n| 2000 July    | U       | Hangman      |\n| 2000 August  | R       | Puzzle       |\n| 2000 Sept    | S       | Crosswords   |\n| 2000 Oct     | X       | Bingo        |\n\n---\n\n### **Set 4: Building Occupants and Flat Assignment**\n\nTen persons – Q, R, S, T, U, B, C, D, E, and F – live in a five-storey building. Floors are numbered 1 (ground) to 5 (top). Each floor has two flats: Flat-1 (West) and Flat-2 (East).\n\n**Clues:**\n\n1.  R lives on an odd-numbered floor.\n2.  U and C live in the same flat number.\n3.  S and B live on the same floor.\n4.  D does not live in Flat-2.\n5.  There is a gap of two floors between R and Q.\n6.  Q and R do not live in the same flat number.\n7.  U lives immediately above Q, in the same flat number.\n8.  There is a gap of one floor between U and C.\n9.  F lives on an even-numbered floor, below B, and both live in the same flat number.\n10. E lives above T, and both live in the same flat number.\n11. D and T live in different flats and on different floors.\n\n**Building Layout:**\n\n| Floor | Flat-1 (West) | Flat-2 (East) |\n| ----- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| 5     | D             | R             |\n| 4     | S             | B             |\n| 3     | U             | E             |\n| 2     | Q             | F             |\n| 1     | C             | T             |\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n*   Assign values: A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21.\n*   Row 5: D (4) * R (18) = 72\n*   Row 4: S (19) * B (2) = 38\n*   Row 3: U (21) * E (5) = 105\n*   Row 2: Q (17) * F (6) = 102\n*   Row 1: C (3) * T (20) = 60\n*   **Total Sum:** 72 + 38 + 105 + 102 + 60 = **377**\n\n---\n\n### **Set 5: Companions, Dress Colors, and Vehicles**\n\nSeven companions – Liam, Maya, Noah, Olivia, Peter, Quinn, and Riley – attended a gathering, each with a unique dress color (Rose, Amber, Obsidian, Forest, Gold, Slate, Burgundy) and arrived in a distinct vehicle color (Slate, Amber, Rose, Obsidian, Azure, Gold, Ivory). No individual's dress color matches their car color.\n\n**Clues:**\n\n*   Maya is dressed in Amber and did not arrive in an Azure or Gold vehicle.\n*   Olivia is wearing a Forest-colored dress and drove an Ivory car.\n*   Liam's dress color is identical to Quinn's car color.\n*   Peter's dress color matches Noah's car color.\n*   Riley is wearing a Slate-colored dress, and Peter arrived in a Slate-colored car.\n*   Quinn is neither wearing a Gold-colored dress nor arrived in a Gold-colored car.\n*   The combination of an Amber dress and a Slate car (or vice-versa) does not belong to any attendee.\n*   Noah is not wearing a Gold-colored dress, and Liam is not wearing a Rose-colored dress.\n\n**Analysis Notes for Puzzle Solving:**\n\n*   If options involve \"ALL,\" \"ANY,\" \"EITHER,\" or \"BOTH,\" they are often the correct answer.\n*   If options are complex and time-consuming, consider checking them from the bottom up.\n\n---\n\nSimple arithmetic: 7 + 9 = 16",
